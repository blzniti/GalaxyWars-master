# Galaxy Wars

Galaxy Wars is a space-themed shooting game developed as a learning project for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class. The game's concept revolves around protecting our world by shooting meteors.

## Game Concept

In Galaxy Wars, players defend a planet from incoming meteors. The main objectives are:

1. Shoot meteors to prevent them from hitting the planet
2. Collect power-ups to enhance gameplay
3. Progress through levels with increasing difficulty

## Key Features

- Space-themed graphics and sound effects
- Player-controlled spaceship for shooting meteors
- Various types of meteors with different behaviors
- Power-up items with special effects (e.g., freeze, shield, automatic shooting)
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Score tracking and time-based gameplay
- Level progression system
- Customizable planet selection

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases several OOP concepts, including:

1. Inheritance: The `Entity` class serves as a base class for game objects like `Player`, `Meteor`, and `Item`.
2. Encapsulation: Classes like `GamePlay` encapsulate game logic and state.
3. Polymorphism: The `update()` and `draw()` methods are implemented differently for various game entities.
4. Interfaces: The `ItemType` interface defines different types of power-ups.
5. Enums: The `Difficulty` enum represents different game difficulty levels.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages:

- `game`: Contains the main game logic and components
- `game.controller`: Handles user input
- `game.entity`: Defines game objects (Player, Meteor, Item, etc.)
- `game.gui`: Manages game UI components
- `game.interfaces`: Defines interfaces used in the game
- `game.util`: Provides utility classes for file management, image handling, and sound

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project's `/src` directory.
4. Compile the project using the following command:
   ```
   javac -d ../bin Main.java game/*.java game/controller/*.java game/entity/*.java game/gui/*.java game/interfaces/*.java game/util/*.java
   ```
5. After successful compilation, navigate to the parent directory:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```
6. Run the main file using the following command:
   ```
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Controls

- Mouse Movement: Aim the crosshair
- Left Mouse Click: Shoot
- Hold Left Mouse Button: Continuous shooting (when automatic power-up is active)
- ESC Key: Pause game / Return to main menu

## Dependencies

- Java Swing: Used for the game's graphical user interface
- Java AWT: Used for graphics and event handling
